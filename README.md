# FullBright-Mod
Simple software I made *a very long time ago*, it can switch fullbright mod in MW2.

Fulbright 4 is low graphics mod, *you can press ALT+A to switch beetween normal and low graphics* (often used in servers).

The process name require to be: 'iw4x.exe', however you can easily change it to another with the sources. See header 'process' variable.

UAC privileges needed.
